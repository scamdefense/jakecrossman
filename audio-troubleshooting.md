# Audio Quality Check and Re-encoding Script

## LATEST FIX: Web-Optimized Video with Range Request Support ✅

### Problems Identified:
1. **Audio crunching on first play**: Low 218kbps audio bitrate + poor web optimization
2. **Video stopping at 7 seconds**: No HTTP range request support for proper streaming  
3. **Perfect audio on replay**: Browser cached the video properly on second attempt

### Current Solution:
**Step 1: Web-optimized re-encoding**
```bash
ffmpeg -i "demo-reel-original.mp4" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 320k -ar 48000 -movflags +faststart -avoid_negative_ts make_zero "demo-reel-web-optimized.mp4"
```

**What this does:**
- `+faststart`: Moves metadata to beginning for better streaming
- `-b:a 320k`: High-quality audio (vs previous 218k)
- `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero`: Fixes timing issues
- `-preset slow`: Better compression for web delivery
- No dynamic processing to avoid artifacts

**Step 2: Proper HTTP Range Request Support**
Updated Flask route to handle byte-range requests, which browsers need for:
- Seeking to specific timestamps
- Progressive loading without buffering entire file
- Proper streaming instead of download-then-play

**Step 3: HTML5 Video Attributes**
Added proper video element attributes:
- `volume="1.0"` and `muted="false"` to prevent browser audio processing
- `controlslist="nodownload"` for cleaner UI

### Video Serving Updates:
- Simplified video route to use direct file serving
- Removed chunking that could affect audio playback
- Added proper caching headers for better performance

## Previous Attempts (AVOID):

### ❌ Over-processed Version (CAUSED CRUNCHING):
```bash
ffmpeg -i "demo-reel.mp4" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 256k -ar 48000 -af "volume=-3dB,dynaudnorm=p=0.95:m=10:s=5:g=3" "demo-reel-fixed.mp4"
```
This caused audio artifacts due to dynamic processing.

### 2. Thumbnail Update
Generated new thumbnail from 5 seconds into the video:
```bash
ffmpeg -i "demo-reel.mp4" -ss 00:00:05 -vframes 1 -q:v 2 "demo-reel-thumbnail.jpg"
```

### 3. Custom Video Route
Previously added a dedicated `/video/<filename>` route that:
- Serves video with proper streaming headers
- Disables caching that could affect audio
- Sets correct MIME types
- Enables byte-range requests for better streaming

### 2. Flask Configuration Updates
- Disabled file caching during development
- Increased max content length for large video files
- Added proper streaming support

### 3. HTML Video Element Updates
- Added `preload="metadata"` for better loading
- Using custom video route instead of static files

## If Audio Still Sounds Weird:

### Option 1: Re-encode with higher audio quality
```bash
ffmpeg -i "app\static\videos\demo-reel.mp4" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 512k -ar 48000 "app\static\videos\demo-reel-hq.mp4"
```

### Option 2: Use uncompressed audio
```bash
ffmpeg -i "app\static\videos\demo-reel.mp4" -c:v copy -c:a pcm_s16le "app\static\videos\demo-reel-uncompressed.avi"
```

### Option 3: Check for browser-specific issues
Test in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to see if the issue is browser-specific.

## Browser Audio Processing
Some browsers apply automatic gain control or audio processing. You can try adding these attributes to your video element:
- `muted="false"`  
- `volume="1.0"`
- `controls="true"`

## Testing
1. Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser
2. Play the video and check if audio sounds better
3. Try different browsers to isolate the issue
4. Compare with local file playback

If the issue persists, it's likely a browser audio processing issue rather than a server compression problem.
